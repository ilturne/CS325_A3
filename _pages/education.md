# Skillset

With skills in over 4 different fields of design, I am the perfect person to hire when it comes to a full fledged project. Whatever your needs are, I can pretty much take on any challenge.

## Product Design
Working at Facebook has taught me a lot about how to understand users, solve problems and build great products.

## Visual Design
My experience at dribbble has helped me learn to develop the eye for design. Colors, typography, layout and the whole package.

## Motion Design
I started my design journey with motion design in my college days. Motion is something that really fascinates me because of the flexibility of story telling.

## Photography
Clicking pictures really brings out the creative in me. Photography really makes you look and perceive things in a different way.
