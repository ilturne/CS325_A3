I am currently in my senior year, actively working on various projects and preparing for my final year. Some of my favorite projects were in my Embedded Systems class. The class was very hands-on and project-oriented, which I really liked. Not only did my programming skills in C exponentially grow, but also my ability to learn from documentation.

I have also been active in learning the Rust programming language. Most of my AI projects are written in Rust. One reason why I love Rust so much is because of its focus on safety. As a new programmer, I still write many programs that have memory vulnerabilities. Rust would have been great in my Microcontrollers class, as I constantly had problems with memory errors in that class.
