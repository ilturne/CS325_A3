Hi, my name is Ilya Turner. I am a computer engineer currently studying at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville. Although my degree is focused on engineering, I have many other passions that I pursue in my free time. I am a photographer, and I have been working on my skills for the past 2 years. I am also a writer, writing a couple of novels and short stories that are pending publishing. I love to be outdoors, I think nature heals the soul and combined with music some of the deepest thoughts can be released. This website is a collection of my work, my thoughts, and my passions. I am always looking for new ways to challenge myself and grow as a person, and I am excited to see where my passions will take me in the future.
