I started Etheral Perspectives in 2022 after a photography class I enrolled in freshmen year of college. I have always been passionate about photography 

The craziest part of starting this company was that it was completely unexpected. One of my photography classmates reached out to me and asked if I would like to help her shoot a wedding. I told her that I had no real professional experience and that I don't think I would be that great, but she was confident in me.

The wedding photoshoot was exhilerating, not only did I get to take photos of people on arguably one of their most important days of their lives, but I also got to build personal connections. From that point on, I knew photography was going to be a great passion of mine and so I thought of collecting all of my work and posting it on a website.

Although I am studying to be a Computer Engineer, photography will always be a great passion of mine and I am hoping to grow it into a small business. It's not just about the photos, to me photography is about the people, the genuine smiles, capturing the experience of looking good and feeling good. My future amibitons is to do shoot more personal photos including grad photos, weddings, portraits, family, and lifestyle photography. 

I am always learning new ways of growing my brand, so if you have any suggestions or would just like to chat about photography or anything else don't hesitate to reach out to me!
